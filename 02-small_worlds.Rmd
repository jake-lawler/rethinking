## Chapter Notes

Opens by drawing a distinction between the small world of the model and the large world of natural reality we are looking to make inferences about. The model is only a representation of the large world and it may exclude or misrepresent salient features, or fall apart outside of a narrow range of contexts.

With that warning, the chapter begins to introduce inverse probability. Say we have four marbles in a bag, and the marbles can be either blue or white. We have five different hypotheses about how many blue and white marbles are in the bag:

1. All marbles are white
2. Three marbles are white, one is blue
3. Two marbles are white, two are blue
4. One marble is white, three are blue
5. All marbles are blue

Which of these is most likely? We want to answer this question by making a series of draws from the bag (with replacement) and using the results of these draws to estimate the relative plausibility of these hypotheses.

Let's say we make three draws with replacement. We see a blue marble, a white marble, and then a blue marble. Call this "b-w-b". 

To illustrate what's going on when we draw from the bag, let's assume temporarily that hypothesis 2 is correct. We want to display every possible result for a series of draws with replacement.

In the code below, I use tidygraph and ggraph to allow this for up to three draws, although more draws could be performed with minor adjustments.

```{r}

# We first create a couple of data frames. One for the nodes - it will provide them labels 
# and assign a colour to them. The other data frame specifies the edges - the connections 
# between the nodes.

# Create nodes - I've chosen to label the nodes so that the zero node is the start - 
# no marbles have been drawn from the bag yet. The first four possible draws are then 
# labelled 1-4. Then once the first draw has been made the nodes representing the second 
# draw have two digits - the first represents the outcome of the first draw (1-4, for each 
# of the four marbles that could have been drawn), and the second digit represents each 
# of the four possible second draws (1-4). So node 34 means that the third marble was 
# drawn on the first draw and the fourth marble on the second draw. The nodes for 
# the third draw are labelled similarly - each with three digits 1 through 4.

level1 <- 1:4 
node <- c(0,level1) # these are the nodes for one draw

for( i in 1:4){
  intermediate <- c(i*10 + level1 )
  node <- c(node,intermediate)
} # this loop creates the nodes after a second draw. probably there is a cleaner way to do this

level2 <- node[node>10]

for( i in 1:4){
  intermediate <- c(i*100 + level2 )
  node <- c(node,intermediate)
} # this loop creates the nodes after a third draw

colour <- as.factor(ifelse(node %% 10 ==1,"blue","white")) # the first marble of each draw is blue, the rest white
node <- as.character(node) # these are node names, not integers
nodes <- tibble(node,colour)

# We now draw the edges between the nodes. Potentially confusing since the integer 1 
# here refers to the first node in the list above i.e. the node labelled "0", and so on. 
# The integer 16 refers to the 16th node in the list above, i.e. to node labelled "33".

from <- rep(1:21,each=4) # each of the first 21 nodes will have four connections
to <- c(2:85)
edges <- tibble(from,to)

# we now create a tbl_graph object for the number of draws we want to display 

draws_1 <- tbl_graph(edges=edges[1:4,], nodes=nodes[1:5,])
draws_2 <- tbl_graph(edges=edges[1:20,], nodes=nodes[1:21,])
draws_3 <- tbl_graph(edges=edges, nodes=nodes)

# we will use this function to plot the tbl_graph objects above

plot_draws <- function(data_frame, layout, circular){
  ggraph(data_frame, layout, circular = circular) + 
    geom_edge_link() + 
    geom_node_point(shape = 21, colour = "black", size = 5, stroke = 1,
                    aes(filter = node != "0", #we don't show the starting node
                        fill=colour))+
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("light blue","white"))+
    theme(legend.position="none")
  }

```

Here are all possible outcomes of one draw from the bag:

```{r}
plot_draws(draws_1,"tree", FALSE)+scale_y_reverse()
```

We have once chance to get a blue marble (there is only one in the bag under our hypothesis), and we have three chances to get a white marble.

We then put the marble we drew back into the bag and draw again. All the possible outcomes  for our two draws are displayed below:

```{r}
plot_draws(draws_2,"tree", FALSE)+scale_y_reverse()
```

For example, the marble on the farthest left represents the situation where we first drew a blue marble, placed in back into the bag, and the drew it again on the second draw.

All possible outcomes of three draws are shown in the below diagram. This time I've made it circular to avoid crowding in the graph. The nodes closest to the centre of the circle represent the first draw, and the nodes on the outside represent the third draw.

```{r}
plot_draws(draws_3,"dendrogram", TRUE)+coord_fixed()
```

How many ways of seeing the sequence "b-w-b" are there under our hypothesis 2?

```{r}
ggraph(draws_3, "dendrogram", circular = TRUE) + 
    geom_edge_link() + 
    geom_node_point(shape = 21, colour = "black", size = 5, stroke = 1,
                    aes(filter = 
                          str_sub(node, 1, 1) == "1" & # criteria for displaying nodes
                          str_sub(node, 2, 2) != "1" &
                          (str_sub(node, -1, -1) == "1" | str_length(node)==2), 
                        fill=colour))+
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("light blue","white"))+
    theme(legend.position="none")+
    coord_fixed()
```

There are three ways of seeing this sequence, displayed above.

By conducting this exercise for each of the five hypotheses above, we are part way to an answer of how plausible each hypothesis is given the sequence of draws we observed.

E.g. for hypothesis 1, there are 0 ways of seeing the observed sequence, since there are no blue marbles in the hypothesis. Similarly for hypothesis 5. The table in the chapter summarises:

![](images\\Ch02Img01.png)

The other information we need to assess the relative plausibility of each hypothesis given the data we need is a measure of the relative plausibility of each hypothesis *before seeing the data*. It might make sense in this case to say that each hypothesis is as likely as any other, but in other circumstances we might believe one of our hypotheses carries a lot more initial plausibility.

We're most of the way to Bayes' rule now, and the next section of the chapter introduces it - moving from the language of counting to the language of probability.

Afterwards, a simple model is introduced. Here's my attempt at recreating figure 2.5:


```{r}

df_plot <- tibble(title=character(),p_grid = numeric(),posterior = numeric(),.rows=0)

grid_length <- 100
num_water <- c(1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6,6)   
num_toss <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)
toss_results <- c("W","L","W","W","W","L","W","L","W") 

# define grid 
p_grid <- seq( from=0 , to=1 , length.out=grid_length )

# define prior 
prior <- rep( 1 , grid_length )

#loop through each of the 9 steps options
for (i in 1:length(num_water)){

  # compute likelihood at each value in grid 
  likelihood <- dbinom( num_water[i] , size=num_toss[i] , prob=p_grid )
  
  # compute product of likelihood and prior 
  unstd_posterior <- likelihood * prior
  
  # standardize the posterior, so it sums to 1
  posterior <- unstd_posterior / sum(unstd_posterior)
  
  df_plot <- df_plot %>% bind_rows(tibble(
                    title = paste(toss_results[1:i], collapse =" "),
                    p_grid = p_grid,
                    posterior = posterior))
}

ggplot(df_plot, aes(x=p_grid, y=posterior)) +
  geom_line()+
  facet_wrap(~title, ncol = 3)+
  xlab("proportion of water")+
  ylab("posterior probability density")

```

What's shown here is the posterior distributions of a globe-tossing model after 9 tosses. At each step, we take a globe and throw it into the air. We catch it, and note where our index finger ends up on the globe - either on water (W) or land (L). We do this nine times and in this way build up an estimate of the proportion of the Earth's surface that is covered by water. The titles of each of the plots above show the sequence that we have observed to that point. We start off by assuming that each proportion is as likely as any other - flat priors.

I've used grid approximation to plot the posteriors in the figure above. Quadratic approximation and Markov chain Monte Carlo are briefly outlined at the end of the chapter.

### 2E4 {-}

#### Question {-}

>The Bayesian statistician Bruno de Finetti (1906–1985) began his 1973 book on probability theory with the declaration: “PROBABILITY DOES NOT EXIST.” The capitals appeared in the original, so I imagine de Finetti wanted us to shout this statement. What he meant is that probability is a device for describing uncertainty from the perspective of an observer with limited knowledge; it has no objective reality. 
>
Discuss the globe tossing example from the chapter, in light of this statement. What does it mean to say “the probability of water is 0.7”?


#### Answer {-}

It's very fun that the question "what do we mean when we talk about probability" is listed as an easy question. 

Bruno de Finetti was a major figure in the subjective Bayesian school. For de Finetti, when someone says “the probability of water is 0.7” they are expressing something about their belief. Maybe that they believe the toy globe is 70% covered in water, or that the real globe is 70% covered in water. Maybe they are expressing something about their expectation for the next toss of the globe. Sometimes subjective Bayesian statements of probability are described in terms of odds that someone would accept on a wager about the belief in question, but this isn't core to the approach (maybe this comes from an overly literal reading of the Dutch Book arguments for the laws of probability).

### 2M3 {-}

#### Question {-}

>Suppose there are two globes, one for Earth and one for Mars. The Earth globe is 70% covered in water. The Mars globe is 100% land. Further suppose that one of these globes — you don’t know which — was tossed in the air and produced a “land” observation. Assume that each globe was equally likely to be tossed. 
>
Show that the posterior probability that the globe was the Earth, conditional on seeing “land”, $\text{Pr}(Earth | Land)$, is 0.23.


#### Answer {-}

Using Bayes Theorem:

$$
\text{Posterior} = \frac{\text{ prior * probability of the data }}{\text{ average probability of the data }}
$$

The numerator for our calculation will be the prior probability that the globe tossed was the Earth, multiplied by the likelihood of seeing land, assuming the globe tossed was the Earth: $0.5 * 0.3$.

The denominator is the sum of these probabilities over each value of the prior. In this case, the prior probability of Mars * probability of seeing land given Mars + prior probability of the Earth * probability of seeing land given Earth: 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * 0.3.  

So we have $\frac{ 0.5 * 0.3 } { 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * 0.3 }$ which is

```{r echo=FALSE}

( 0.5 * 0.3 ) / ( 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * 0.3 )

```

as required.


### 2M4 {-}

#### Question {-}

>Suppose you have a deck with only three cards. Each card has two sides, and each side is either black or white. One card has two black sides. The second card has one black and one white side. The third card has two white sides. Now suppose all three cards are placed in a bag and shuffled. Someone reaches into the bag and pulls out a card and places it flat on a table. A black side is shown facing up, but you don’t know the color of the side facing down. 
>
Show that the probability that the other side is also black is 2/3. Use the counting method (Section 2 of the chapter) to approach this problem. This means counting up the ways that each card could produce the observed data (a black side facing up on the table).


#### Answer {-}

We are looking for the posterior probability that we have chosen the black/black card (Card One), given that we see a black side facing up.

We assume for now that the chance of choosing each card is the same. That is that for every 1 way of choosing Card One, there is 1 way of choosing Card Two, and 1 way of choosing Card Three. Now we need to count up the number of ways of seeing a black side for each of the cards.

* Card One (black/black) 
There are two ways of seeing a black side after choosing this card - we could lay side one face up, or side two.

* Card Two (black/white) 
There is only one way of seeing a black side after choosing this card - we would need to lay side one face up.

* Card Three (white/white) 
There are no ways of seeing a black side after choosing this card.


Our calculation is $\frac{1 * 2}{1 * 2 + 1 * 1 + 1 * 0} = \frac{2}{2+1+0} = \frac{2}{3}$.


### 2M5 {-}

#### Question {-}

>Now suppose there are four cards: B/B, B/W, W/W, and another B/B. Again suppose a card is drawn from the bag and a black side appears face up. Again calculate the probability that the other side is black.


#### Answer {-}

We are looking for the probability that we have chosen either Card One or Card Four.

Following the logic above, we get $\frac{2 + 2}{2 + 2 + 1 + 0} = \frac{4}{5}$.


### 2M6 {-}

#### Question {-}

>Imagine that black ink is heavy, and so cards with black sides are heavier than cards with white sides. As a result, it’s less likely that a card with black sides is pulled from the bag. So again assume there are three cards: B/B, B/W, and W/W. After experimenting a number of times, you conclude that for every way to pull the B/B card from the bag, there are 2 ways to pull the B/W card and 3 ways to pull the W/W card. Again suppose that a card is pulled and a black side appears face up. 
>
Show that the probability the other side is black is now 0.5. Use the counting method, as before.


#### Answer {-}

We just replace the 1's from 2M4 with the new relative number of ways of pulling each card:

* B/B: 1 way
* B/W: 2 ways
* W/W: 3 ways

Our calculation is $\frac{1 * 2}{1 * 2 + 2 * 1 + 3 * 0} = \frac{2}{2+2+0} = \frac{1}{2}$.


### 2M7 {-}

#### Question {-}

>Assume again the original card problem, with a single card showing a black side face up. Before looking at the other side, we draw another card from the bag and lay it face up on the table. The face that is shown on the new card is white. 
>
Show that the probability that the first card, the one showing a black side, has black on its other side is now 0.75. Use the counting method, if you can. 
>
Hint: Treat this like the sequence of globe tosses, counting all the ways to see each observation, for each possible first card.


#### Answer {-}

We are again looking for the probability that the first card we pulled was Card One (b/b), given the data (that we see one card with a black side and then one card with a white side).

we will use a table:

```{r echo = FALSE}

card_posterior <- tibble(
  
  Cards = c("Card One","Card Two","Card Three"),
  `Prior Count` = rep(1,3),
  `Black Side Count` = c(2,1,0),
  `White Side Count` = c(3,2,1)
  
)

card_posterior <- mutate(card_posterior, `Posterior Count` = `Prior Count` * `Black Side Count` * `White Side Count`)

kable(card_posterior)



```


For each row, we derive the White Side Counts by adding up the number of ways to see a white side for the two cards left in the bag. E.g. if we pulled Card One first, we have one card remaining with two white sides, and one card remaining with one white side = 3 white sides. 


Our probability that we first pulled Card One is then $\frac{6}{6+2} = 0.75$ as required.


### 2H1 {-}

#### Question {-}

>Suppose there are two species of panda bear. Both are equally common in the wild and live in the same places. They look exactly alike and eat the same food, and there is yet no genetic assay capable of telling them apart. They differ however in their family sizes. Species A gives birth to twins 10% of the time, otherwise birthing a single infant. Species B births twins 20% of the time, otherwise birthing singleton infants. Assume these numbers are known with certainty, from many years of field research. 
>
Now suppose you are managing a captive panda breeding program. You have a new female panda of unknown species, and she has just given birth to twins. What is the probability that her next birth will also be twins?


#### Answer {-}


```{r echo = FALSE}

panda_posterior <- tibble(
  
  Species = c("Species A","Species B"),
  `Prior Count` = c(1,1),
  `Twins Count` = c(1,2)
  
)

panda_posterior <- mutate(panda_posterior, `Posterior Count` = `Prior Count` * `Twins Count`,
                          `Posterior Probability` = round(`Posterior Count` / sum(`Posterior Count`),2))

kable(panda_posterior)



```


Probability of having twins is $\text{probability of species } A * 0.1 + \text{probability of species } B * 0.2 = 1/3 * 0.1 + 2/3 * 0.2 = 1/6$.


### 2H2 {-}

#### Question {-}

>Recall all the facts from the problem above. Now compute the probability that the panda we have is from species A, assuming we have observed only the first birth and that it was twins.


#### Answer {-}

This questions implies that there was an easier way of answering the first question.

In any case, we have already calculated that the probability of species A is 1/3.


### 2H3 {-}

#### Question {-}

>Continuing on from the previous problem, suppose the same panda mother has a second birth and that it is not twins, but a singleton infant. Compute the posterior probability that this panda is species A.

#### Answer {-}


```{r echo = FALSE}

panda_posterior <- tibble(
  
  Species = c("Species A","Species B"),
  `Prior Count` = c(1,1),
  `Twins Count` = c(1,2),
  `Singleton Count` = c(9,8)
  
)

panda_posterior <- mutate(panda_posterior, `Posterior Count` = `Prior Count` * `Twins Count` * `Singleton Count`,
                          `Posterior Probability` = `Posterior Count` / sum(`Posterior Count`))

kable(panda_posterior)



```


The probability of species A is now 36%.


### 2H4 {-}

#### Question {-}

>A common boast of Bayesian statisticians is that Bayesian inference makes it easy to use all of the data, even if the data are of different types. So suppose now that a veterinarian comes along who has a new genetic test that she claims can identify the species of our mother panda. But the test, like all tests, is imperfect. This is the information you have about the test: 
>
* The probability it correctly identifies a species A panda is 0.8. 
* The probability it correctly identifies a species B panda is 0.65.
>
The vet administers the test to your panda and tells you that the test is positive for species A. First ignore your previous information from the births and compute the posterior probability that your panda is species A. Then redo your calculation, now using the birth data as well.

#### Answer {-}

Using test results alone:

```{r echo = FALSE}

panda_posterior <- tibble(
  
  Species = c("Species A","Species B"),
  `Prior Count` = c(1,1),
  `Test for A` = c(8,2)
  
)

panda_posterior <- mutate(panda_posterior, `Posterior Count` = `Prior Count` * `Test for A`,
                          `Posterior Probability` = `Posterior Count` / sum(`Posterior Count`))

kable(panda_posterior)



```



Using births and test results:


```{r echo = FALSE}

panda_posterior <- tibble(
  
  Species = c("Species A","Species B"),
  `Prior Count` = c(1,1),
  `Twins Count` = c(1,2),
  `Singleton Count` = c(9,8),
  `Test for A` = c(8,2)
)

panda_posterior <- mutate(panda_posterior, `Posterior Count` = `Prior Count` * `Twins Count` * `Singleton Count` * `Test for A`,
                          `Posterior Probability` = round(`Posterior Count` / sum(`Posterior Count`),2))

kable(panda_posterior)



```
